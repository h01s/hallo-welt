Hello humons,

copying and pasting Linus Torvalds quotes is so much fun:

"Give me one reason why it was written in that idiotic way with two different conditionals, and a shiny new non-standard function that wants particular compiler support to generate even half-way sane code, and even then generates worse code? A shiny function that we have never ever needed anywhere else, and that is just compiler-masturbation."

"And it's a ****ing bad excuse for that brain damage. I'm sorry, but we don't add idiotic new interfaces like this for idiotic new code like that".

Bye.
